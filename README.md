## Part 1: Imaging Technique Inspiration

### Inspiration Sources

My imaging technique inspiration comes from two iconic works:

**Salvador Dalí - The Persistence of Memory (1931)**

**The Matrix (1999) - Digital Rain Effect**

### What I Want to Incorporate

I'm inspired by the concept of **time distortion and reality transformation**. Dalí's melting clocks show that time is fluid and subjective, not rigid. The Matrix shows how reality can be manipulated through code and digital effects.

For my project, I want to create an interactive clock that accelerates and transforms. The clock spins faster over time, generating chaotic visual patterns that eventually clear to reveal a transformed reality - like breaking through the matrix or waking from a dream. This technique creates a narrative: **order → chaos → transformation**, exploring themes of time, perception, and digital reality.

## Part 2: Coding Technique Exploration

### The Coding Technique

**Object-Oriented Programming with Dynamic Arrays and Time Control**

Key elements:
- Custom classes to manage visual elements
- Arrays to store and iterate through objects
- Time-based triggers (`millis()` function)
- Mathematical transformations for rotation

### How It Helps

This technique allows me to:
- Build up visual complexity gradually (random shapes generated as clock accelerates)
- Create sudden transformation (clearing everything after 10 seconds)
- Give each shape independent properties (color, size, rotation, gradient)
- Achieve the chaotic yet structured aesthetic from both Dalí and The Matrix

The combination of loops, conditionals, and arrays creates the illusion of time accelerating and reality fragmenting, then resetting.

**Key Techniques:**
- Classes and constructors
- Arrays with `push()` method
- `for...of` loops
- Time control with `millis()`
- Trigonometry (`cos`, `sin`)

## Summary

Interactive artwork merging Dalí's surrealist time with Matrix's digital reality. Click to start a clock that accelerates while spawning geometric shapes. After 10 seconds, everything clears - a metaphor for transformation and awakening.
